	 * , downloadFile($fileId)
	 * 
	 * Function: checkIfFileExistsOnFileServer($filePath)
	 * Purpose: This function will check if the input file name already exists on the file server. If it does, 
	 * this function will modify the name of the file until it finds a file name that doesn't exist on the file server.
	 * and if the input file name exists on the file server, it returns a file name that doesn't exist on the file server.
	 * Variable: $filePath includes the name of the file.
	 * 
	 * Function: uploadFile($htmlElement, $fileStorageLocation)
	 * Purpose: This function will recieve any number of files from an html form. This 
	 * function will then insert the location and name of the file into a database, and then save the actual file on 
	 * the file server. Finally, it will return $successMessage, which is described in the variables section.
	 * Variables: $htmlElement contains all of the uploaded files. 
	 * 			$fileStorageLocation is the destination file path for the uploaded files. 
	 * 			$uploadedFileNameSaveLocation is the destination file path for the uploaded files in to the file name. 
	 * 			$successMessage contains a number between 0 and 4; 0 means failure, 1 means success, 2 means 
	 * 				database error, 3 means file server error, and 4 means no files were uploaded.
	 * 
	 * Function: downloadFile($fileId)
	 * Purpose: This function will recieve the database ID for a file. It will query the database for that ID.
	 * If the ID exists in the database, it will return the file location for that record. Finally, this function will
	 * force the file to be downloaded to the client's system.
	 * Variables: $successMessage contains either a 0 or a 1; 0 means failure, and 1 means success.
