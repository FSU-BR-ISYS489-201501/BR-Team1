 * Page created for use in the JCI Project.
 * Project work is done as part of a Capstone class ISYS489: Ferris State University.
 * Purpose: The purpose of this file is to display a page in the browser that shows all
 * announcements (active and inactive) with buttons that will allow the edit, activation, and
 * deactivation of announcements.
 * Credit: I used code written by Michael J. Calkins as an inspiration for executing a function
 * through a php link. This was obtained from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19323010/execute-php-function-with-onclick.
 * I used code written by Shane Workman to make database queries.
 *
 * Revision1.1: MM/DD/YYYY Author: Name Here 
 * Description of change. Also add //Name: comments above your change within the code.
