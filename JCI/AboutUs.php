<h2>Publication Information</h2>
<p>
The goals of the Society of Case Research <a href="http://www.sfcr.org">www.sfcr.org</a> are to help authors develop and publish worthy business case studies. The Journal of Critical Incidents (JCI) does not publish does not publish long cases. JCI’s focus is on brief incidents that tell about a real situation in a real organization (similar to end-of-chapter cases in textbooks). The critical incident tells a story about an event, an experience, a blunder, or a success. Unlike a long case, the incident provides only limited historical detail or how the situation developed. Rather, it focuses on a real time snapshot that stimulates student user of their knowledge to arrive at a course of action or analysis.
</p>
<p> 
Critical incidents can be based on either field work or library research. The maximum length of the critical incidents is three single-spaced pages. A teaching note must be submitted with the critical incident. The quality of the teaching note is a central factor in the review and acceptance process. Submissions are double-blind, peer reviewed. Formatted copies of acceptable critical requirements. The Journal of Critical Incidents is listed in <a href="http://www.cabells.com/">Cabell’s Directories of Publishing Opportunities</a> and is published annually in the Fall.
