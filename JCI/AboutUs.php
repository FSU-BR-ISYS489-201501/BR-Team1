<h2>JCI Mission and Purpose</h2>
<p>
The Journal of Critical Incidents does not publish long cases. JCI's focus is on brief incidents that tell about real situation in a real organization. The incident tells a story about an event, an experience, a blunder, or a success. Unlike a long case, the incident does not provide historical detail or how the situation developed. Rather, it provides a snapshot that stimulates student use of their knowledge to arrive at a course of action or analysis.
Critical incidents can be based on either field work or library research. The maximum length of the Critical incidents is three single-spaced pages. See the Style Guide for layout and submission requirements.
