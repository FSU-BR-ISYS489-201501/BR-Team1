 * Page created for use in the JCI Project.
 * Project work is done as part of a Capstone class ISYS489: Ferris State University.
 * Purpose: The purpose of this file is to check the database in order to verify that all 
 * approved for publish Critical Inicidents have at least one file associated with it in the
 * files table. If all approved Critical Incidents have at least one file associated with it, 
 * a submit button is generated. If all approved Critical Incidents do not have at least one
 * file associated with it, an error message is displayed.
 * 
 * Currently, pushing the submit button does nothing.
 * 
 * Credit: Give any attributation to code used within, not created by you.
 *
 * Function:  functionName($myVar, $varTwo)
 * Purpose: This is the description of what the function does.
 * Variable: $myVar - Description of variable.
 * Variable: $varTwo - Another description.
 *
 * Function:  functionNameTwo($anotherVar)
 * Purpose: This is the description of what the function does.
 * Variable: $anotherVar - Description of variable.
